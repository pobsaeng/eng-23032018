I have been planning to learn English.
First of all, I have to practice more my English and would you mind if I will plan the lessons by myself because I have just 6 months left that to make it succeed.
After I met you which I counted it is the first time, You make me better speak confident English, taught me well, and I dare to speak English

I will explain to you that my new plan for English learning in a nutshell. 
- I would like to prepare myself for learning of each lesson (chapter)
- I will prepare the questions to ask you in the lesson (so much)
- I want you to tell me is correct when I say wrong grammar or I spell mistake
- I would like to select the lesson of each time (I will give you the information in advance)

I know, You have excellent experience for teaching in English but I know my problem very well that how I should do, how I can speak English fluently
Don't stress your mind na krub ajan Dom, I just want to solve my problem in a short time (6 months)
